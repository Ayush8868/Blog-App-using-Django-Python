# Blog-App-using-Django-Python

This is a Blog Website built using Django, which allows users to interact with blog posts through the following features:

User Authentication:

Login: Users can register and log in to their account using their username and password.
Logout: Logged-in users can log out of their account, which ends their session and redirects them to the homepage or login page.
CRUD Operations for Blog Posts:

Create: Logged-in users can create new blog posts by providing a title, content, and image (optional).
Read: Users can view individual blog posts by clicking on the blog title or image. A list of recent blog posts is displayed on the homepage or a dedicated blog listing page.
Update: Users can edit their own blog posts to modify the content or update the title and image.
Delete: Users can delete their blog posts. Once deleted, the post is permanently removed from the website.
Admin Panel:

Admin users can manage all blog posts, including the ability to delete inappropriate content or manage user accounts through the Django Admin interface.
User Profiles:

Each user has their profile page, where they can see a list of their own blog posts.
Users can update their profile information, such as changing their email or password.
Security Features:

Passwords are securely hashed using Djangoâ€™s built-in password hashing mechanisms.
Only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete posts, ensuring that no one can manipulate posts that they do not own.
Responsive Design:

The website is designed to be mobile-friendly, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
